I Code in ""**PHP**"" and "**Node.JS**" as back-end and "**React.JS**" as front-end.
I don't like __WordPress__ and __C#__.

I'm also skilled in __Docker__, __Redis__, __MySQL__.
I can build Robots on __Discord__, __Telegram__, __Twitter__ and Other social media services who provide API for that.

in __PHP__ I'm familiar with __Laravel__, __Symfony__ and a Little __Zend__.
while on Front-end, I'd rather use __React + TypeScript__, and __Next.JS__ to make it SSR (Server Side Rendered).

While on deploying a project, I always use __Nginex__ as Webserver (I Hate Apache BTW),
and to add a bit of spice and ease to it, I use __Docker__.

while on Testing my application, I do __Laravel UnitTests__ for __Laravel__ and __Jest__ for __Javascript/TypeScript__ using GitLab-Ci or GitHub Actions to make it much faster and reliable.

I know how to Configure a server from it's roots, and Virtualize it using __KVM/VMWare/...__ or maybe possibly __Docker__.
